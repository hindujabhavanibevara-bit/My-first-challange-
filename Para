An interactive page is a dynamic website that encourages user engagement through elements like clickable buttons, forms, animations, and videos, rather than just presenting static information. It creates a two-way communication experience, responding to user actions and adapting to their interactions to provide more meaningful and memorable experiences. Interactive pages are crucial for increasing user engagement, retaining attention, and ultimately improving a website's overall effectiveness and search engine rankings.
